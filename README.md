YOLOv8 Ball Tracking with ESP32 and Servos

This repository presents a computer vision and IoT project that enables real-time ball tracking using artificial intelligence. Utilizing YOLOv8, the system detects the ball's position and, via TCP/IP, sends signals to an ESP32, which adjusts the orientation of two servomotors to follow the ball's movement.

üéØ Project Objective

Develop a computer vision and IoT system capable of detecting and tracking objects in real-time, applicable to automation, robotics, and sports. This project demonstrates expertise in machine learning, image processing, network communication, and embedded systems.

üìå Technologies & Tools

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics): Deep learning model for real-time object detection.

OpenCV: Image processing and ball coordinate extraction.

Python (Sockets, NumPy, OpenCV): Implementation of image processing and communication with ESP32.

ESP32 + MicroPython / Arduino IDE: Servo control based on received data.

TCP/IP Communication Protocols: Transmission of detection data between the computer and ESP32.

Embedded Hardware: Integration of microcontrollers and actuators.
